# Human-interaction-object-following

Real-time human skeleton and object tracking algorithm based on kinectv2. The algorithm integrates color and depth images and comes with color, shape and human skeleton tracking (human-robot interaction), among other features. The internal and external parameters of the camera calibration can be adjusted. The parameters of the robot are given in the reference file, and the reference point information is sent to the robot controller in the form of a linear discretization.

The demo and the results are referenced in the video file
